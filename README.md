### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! 

I'm Sywen.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the intersection of distributed systems, and data-driven solutions. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning knowledges in implementing consensus algorithms, optimizing microservices, and building resilient system architectures. I love to bring a scalability mindset to projects, big or small. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.

### Fun facts: 

- I started in social impact consulting and counseling psychology before transitioning into engineering. I still love exploring how technology can create real-world impact in healthcare and social innovation.

- It is amazing to turn ideas into codes to solve real-world problems, but I also enjoy making fun things!

- In my free time, I like to brainstorm ideas and bring ideas to life through code.

âœ¨ **Letâ€™s build something impactful together!** ðŸš€
